# One-page website Portfolio

A one-page website (landing page), laid out according to the layout (Figma). The project is adapted for mobile devices and added a burger menu.

Stack and what I did: Made a layout adapted for mobile devices. I used an SCSS preprocessor for styles. I used Flex and Grid. I used Gulp for build and optimization. I converted images to WebP format to speed up the site's loading.
